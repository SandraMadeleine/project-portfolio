The assignment was to create a portfolio from a pre-set design in Figma. We were allowed to change colors. I have had less time than usual to complete this project and 
found that the time I had was too little, so I will need to complete this project at a later time point. 
I can not get flex to work anywhere, so I can not even center content, will need to look into what I have done to cause that. Due to not being able to place content where it should be, the page is not responsive and thus has no media queries. I also had to leave the accessibility part for later fixes of this page.
